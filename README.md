## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or npm/pnpm)
-   A free [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account
-   A free cloud-based MySQL/MariaDB database (e.g., [TiDB Cloud Serverless](https://tidbcloud.com/), [Aiven](https://aiven.io/))

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<Your-GitHub-Username>/culina.git
    cd culina
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following variables.

    ```env
    # Database Connection (from your cloud provider like TiDB Cloud)
    DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?sslaccept=strict"
    SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?sslaccept=strict"

    # Clerk Authentication Keys (from your Clerk dashboard)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
    CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
    ```

4.  **Sync the database schema with Prisma:**
    This command will read your `prisma/schema.prisma` file and apply the changes to your database.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
